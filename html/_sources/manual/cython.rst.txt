Cython
======

To speed things up, Envelope1D has a Cython version that must be compiled.
You can do so by going to `lightwin/source` and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python util/setup.py build_ext --inplace

A `.so` (Linux) or `.pyd` (Windows) file will be created.
If it is not done automatically, move the created file in ``beam_calculation/envelope_1d/``:
Unix: ``build/lib.linux-XXX-cpython=3XX/beam_calculation/envelope_1d/transfer_matrices_c.cpython-3XX-XXXX-linux-gnu.so``
Windows: ``build/lib.win-XXXX-cpython-3XX/beam_calculation/envelope_1d/transfer_matrices_c.cp3XX-win_XXXX.pyd``

Note that if you use an interpreter such as Spyder, you should restart the kernel to correctly load the file.
If you change your Python version or use another machine, you must recompile.
